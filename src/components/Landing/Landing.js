					<h4>Inspired by large deficit in voter turnout and the desire to increase 
                        voter knowledge, Gulfport Votes 100% was replicated from a previous initiative 
                        in Massachusetts by the same founder.  Our goal is to increase voter turnout 
                        and inspire citizens to become informed on their candidates and amendments.</h4>
